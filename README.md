# Temporal Feature Engineering Package
This repository provides a streamlined way to generate temporal features for machine learning models from tabular data. It is designed for use cases where data is structured as [date, id, features] and requires computations (e.g., average, standard deviation) over a specified time window (e.g., 7 days). The package supports large-scale datasets, leveraging parallelization and efficient data structures where possible.

Key Features
Flexible Rolling Windows
Specify a time window (e.g., 7d, 30d, etc.) to compute rolling statistics like average, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.

Scalable Architecture
Built to handle large datasets using efficient data handling and optional distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Dask, Spark).

Ease of Use
Provide intuitive APIs that allow you to:

Define the temporal span.
Choose aggregations (e.g., avg, std).
Automatically generate feature columns.
Consistent Data Structures
Work with standard tabular formats containing [date, id, features] columns to ensure easy adoption in existing data pipelines.

# Installation
To install the package, clone the repository and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/temporal-feature-engineering.git
cd temporal-feature-engineering
pip install .

Scalability
For massive datasets:

Distributed Computation: The package can optionally integrate with frameworks like Dask or Apache Spark. Simply pass your distributed DataFrame into the TemporalFeatureGenerator for large-scale processing.
Memory Efficiency: Uses chunk-based calculations when possible to limit peak memory usage.

# Development Roadmap
Additional Aggregations
Expand beyond basic aggregations to include median, skewness, kurtosis, etc.
Time-Shifting
Support forward- and backward-looking windows for causal inference or forecasting scenarios.
Feature Selection Tools
Integrate correlation-based and importance-based methods to help identify the most relevant temporal features.
Advanced Parallelization
Enhance performance for extremely large datasets using more sophisticated partitioning and caching strategies.
